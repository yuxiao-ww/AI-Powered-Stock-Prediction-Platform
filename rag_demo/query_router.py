    Question: {query}

    An "analytical" question typically involves numerical analysis, statistics, or specific data calculations. It often requires working with structured data like in a pandas DataFrame. Examples include:
    - What is the average stock price for a specific company?
    - Which company has the highest stock price?
    - How has the stock price of a company changed over time?

    A "general" question is broader and relates to company descriptions, products, services, or comparisons that don't require specific data analysis. These questions can typically be answered based on general knowledge about companies. Examples include:
    - What are the main products of Adobe?
    - Which companies compete with Facebook in social media?
    - What is the primary business focus of Google?
    - How does Microsoft's product portfolio compare to Apple's?
